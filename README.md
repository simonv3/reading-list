## Dev

### ToDo

### Getting Started

Read uses [hoodie](http://docs.hood.ie/en/start/).

```
git clone git@github.com:simonv3/reading-list
npm install
```

You need to have the hoodie server running:

```
hoodie start
```

And if you want to actively develop on the reading list:

```
gulp watch
```
